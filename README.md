# dartistics-googleanalytics
Standalone R examples for Google Analytics -- published as a sub-site within dartistics.com

This project is set to publish the HTML to the [dartistics.com repository](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/dartistics.com) (to a /googleanalytics folder within the main project folder). So, before building a website with this project, the dartistics.com repo should be located in a directory at the same level as this project's directory.
